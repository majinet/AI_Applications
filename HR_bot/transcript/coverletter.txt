As an IT manager with over five years of experience at HKEx, I possess a deep understanding of IT service management best practices and have honed my skills in collecting user requirement, team and vendor management, deliver test planning, rollout and contingency strategy. With more than a decade of experience in supervisory roles, I have a proven track record of successfully delivering new or upgraded systems on schedule and without critical defects.
My primary focus has always been to ensure that our projects and SDLC processes adhere to the highest standards and policies set forth by HKEx. In our most recent project, which involved modernizing the Clearing system, we embraced Agile methodologies and leveraged DevOps tools to enhance collaboration across different departments and teams. We implemented a robust CI/CD platform that enabled automation in SDLC, thereby increasing productivity. We also integrated code and security scanning into our CI/CD pipeline to review code quality more efficiently. Thanks to these efforts, we were able to consistently deliver high-quality deliverables to production.
In the technical aspect, I have deep understanding about key considerations when designing a large-scale enterprise system though scalability, high availability, redundancy, and security. I have learned disaster recovery and business continuity plans are crucial to ensure a quick response to system outages and to minimize any negative impact on business reputation. To maintain a 100% uptime, we continuously monitor the system and provide regular maintenance to ensure that the system runs smoothly and efficiently at all times.
Throughout my experience working with DevOps over the past several years, I have discovered a true passion for applying automation solutions in software development. Recognizing the immense benefits that automation brings to the SDLC, I made the challenging decision to leave HKEx and dedicate myself to expanding my knowledge and skills in the realms of Cloud native , containerization, event stream, and AI.
I am proud to showcase my commitment and expertise through various projects on GitHub, where I actively share my ideas and demonstrate tangible proof of concepts.
By leveraging my background in managing large-scale projects, deep understanding of IT service management, and adeptness with DevOps tools, I am well-equipped to bring automation solutions to support development teams. My continuous learning in innovative technologies ensures that I stay at the forefront of industry trends, enabling me to deliver valuable outcomes.
