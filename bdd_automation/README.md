# Test Automation with AI


## Goals of Project

The main goal of this project is to implement test automation with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve test coverage and accuracy. By utilizing AI, we aim to reduce manual effort required for testing and ensure that our test cases are executed with a high degree of precision.


## Test Automation Technology Implementation

We will be using OpenAI's ChatGPT, a large language model for natural language processing and generation to implement test automation with AI. The test automation will follow the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach and be implemented using the Python programming language.

We will use Behave to translate our Gherkin syntax into executable code. Gherkin syntax allows us to describe test scenarios in plain English and provides a common language for all stakeholders involved in the development process. Behave, on the other hand, allows us to map these scenarios to Python code and run them as automated tests.

To implement the test steps, we will use Python's unittest framework. Unittest is a testing framework built into Python and provides a set of tools for constructing and running tests. It also provides methods for asserting expected outcomes and reporting test results.

By leveraging AI, BDD, and Python-based test automation frameworks, we can ensure that our test automation is efficient, accurate, and maintains high code quality. The use of AI in test automation brings significant benefits, including reduced manual effort, faster feedback loops, and increased test coverage.
